# marketData
Market data is a broad term for trade-related data. It encompasses a range of information such as price, bid/ask quotes and market volume for financial instruments. Financial firms, traders and investors require such data to execute trades. Market data is generated in real time, which means that it can be used to make quick but informed trading decisions. In the meantime, historical market data are a crucial part of technical analysis, and can be used to project pricing trends and to calculate risk.
